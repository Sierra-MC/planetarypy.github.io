This marks the day that the initial commit was made to the Tecnical
Committee (TC) repository within the planetarypy GitHub org.  Although
individuals had been working for some time prior to this to conceive 
of a modern PlanetaryPy Project that mirrored the Astropy Project, 
this commit is when that work got a little more concrete.
